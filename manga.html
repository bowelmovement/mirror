<b>x. Enlightenment -- Manga</b><br>

<p>
The manga capture of the Mirror Card is very similar to the anime. However, there are little differences. I've noticed that there are virtually no translations for the manga chapters, so I have the chapter of the Mirror Card below. Enjoy!</p>

<p>
The chapter began with Sakura heading out to buy some groceries. She was greeted by Yukito when she arrived home. She finds that Yukito is giving Touya a hair cut and daydreams about how cool it would be to receive a hair cut from Yukito.^_^ Yukito then offers Sakura a hair cut, and a blushing Sakura eagerly accepted. Needless to say, she is thinking "I'm so happy I could die!" XD Touya came in with tea, and Yukito offered to clean up. They did not know, however, that someone was watching them from the outside...
</p>

<p>
On another part of town, Yamazaki and Chiharu were examining stuffed penguins in a toy store while Yamazaki told ridiculous stories regarding penguins.^^ Chiharu caught a glimpse of who looked like Sakura, and called out to her. Chiharu watched with shock as Sakura pushed a stack of stuffed animals off of the display and rushed off. She was thoroughly confused. XD
</p>

<p>
The next day, Chiharu confronted Sakura in the classroom, asking if she was at the toy store yesterday. Sakura denied it, and told Chiharu that she was at the grocery store yesterday and that Yukito was at her house and cut her hair. Syaoran was startled and furious, and Yamazaki had to hold Syaoran down and calm him by saying that they can settle things during badminton today. Yamazaki then went on creating a story about how in ancient Rome, they used badminton to fight and decide things. Some of the kids believe the story and others think it's a joke. <br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>
When gym class came along, Syaoran eagerly volunteered and chose Sakura to be his partner in a match. Syaoran questioned Sakura on why Yukito was at her house yesterday and Sakura defended that he was Touya's friend. Just then, Touya, Yukito, and other high school students ran by and Yukito shouted out a good luck to Sakura and Syaoran and waved. Syaoran was speechless and wacked a birdie straight at Sakura, signifying the start of the match. Sakura thought that Yukito-san was watching, so she must surely win...<br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>
Later, Sakura and Tomoyo were talking and Tomoyo said that the match had no conclusion because they were continuing even though gym class had ended. ^-^ Tomoyo said she would cut Sakura's hair next time because she likes Sakura. *^-^* Just then, Sakura saw a girl looking just like her on rollerblades speeding away. Then Chiharu and Naoko came by and asked why Sakura knocked over merchandise at the stationary store. Tomoyo said Sakura was with her the whole time, and Sakura said that she has never knocked over things. <br><center>***</center></p>

<p>
Later, Sakura confronted Kero about this bizarre situation and Kero suggested fortune telling using the cards. Sakura shuffled the cards and arranged them into piles, then placed them in order. Then she did a chant and turned over the Windy card. Kero said the Windy was the card of communication and information. Kero made Sakura recall the time the Sword used Rika to get to her house and that it was different from the others because it came straight to Sakura after it awakened. The Sword controlled Rika so Sakura couldn't fight back. Then Kero told Sakura that when Sakura captured the Shadow, the Shadow's intention was to test Sakura, so it went to the shop that Touya worked in. All of the cards that Sakura captured know about her and not all of the cards have awakened yet. Kero went on saying that all of the cards have different personalities and some don't care for Sakura like others do. Next Sakura turned over 3 other cards, the Watery, the Illusion, and the Shadow. Kero explained that these 3 cards are associated with the identical Sakura...<br><center>***</center>
</p>


<p>
Meanwhile, Touya was riding his bike home when he met with a Sakura on rollerblades. Sakura smiled at him and he looked back at her oddly...<br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>
Back at home Sakura flipped over the last card, the Flower. Kero said this card will reveal who was in danger. Sakura thought of Touya, whose name means Peach Blossoms, and realized that Touya was in danger...<br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>
Over by the forest, Sakura was leading Touya through the woods for something that she lost. Sakura is on rollerblading as fast as she can towards the mirror Sakura with Kero, telling him that she can sense where the card is. They found Touya's bike and raced into the forest. Once Sakura was in the forest, she couldn't sense Touya's presence anymore...<br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>
In the other part of the forest, Touya was searching for the thing that the fake Sakura lost. Sakura told him to go further into the forest...and suddenly, the ground beneath Touya's foot gave and he barely had time to catch himself on the edge of a high cliff. Slowly, the rock he was hanging on to crumbled and he fell down the tall cliff...<br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the real Sakura was in tears because she couldn't figure out how to help her brother. Syaoran appeared out of the bushes, saying that he's after a clow card. Sakura pleaded to Syaoran to help her find Touya *^-^* and Syaoran agreed, using his Rashinban to pinpoint the clow card and Touya's location...<br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the cliff, Touya was struggling to stay concious and asked where the thing that she lost was. He said he may be able to help her find it, and stuggled to stand up. His foot was injured in the fall, so he could not stand up. He told the fake Sakura to keep looking for what she lost so she can stop imitating Sakura. He also told her that she can stop being a ghost if she's at peace. He said he knew from the beginning that she wasn't a living human, and when she finds what she's looking for, she can go to Heaven. ^-^ Just before losing conciousness, Touya asked her to say hello to his mother when she went back...<br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>
Syaoran had pinpointed the clow card's position down the cliff and Sakura used the Fly card to go down. They discovered the unconcious Touya and was relieved to see that he was still alive. Sakura was furious at the clow card and called the Windy to attack it. It went through the clow card harmlessly and Kero ordered Sakura to use a stronger attack card. Sakura used the Watery, which still had no effect on it. Kero said the card is effective as a defense or attack card, and that ordinary magic won't return it to a card. Sakura must know the card and say its name to return it to a clow card. So Sakura faced it, shut her eyes, and thought of how the Watery, Illusion, and the Shadow related to it. When she reopened her eyes, she found that the card was imitating her by holding an imaginary staff. She then realized that the card moves like a shadow, reflects like water, and is not real, like an illusion, so the card must be the Mirror Card. With that, the card revealed its true form and flew over to the unconcious Touya. She kissed him gently on the cheek with tears falling, and said "I'm sorry." Sakura then returned the Mirror into a clow card and took Touya home. 
</p>

<p>
Back at home, Sakura was feeding Touya even though Touya claimed he could have gone down himself. Kero was with Sakura and as usual, sweating like crazy and desperately remaining a "stuffed animal." Sakura said she was lonely cooking by herself so she brought Kero along. :) Before she left, Sakura said sorry to Touya. When Touya asked why, she just said nothing and left. Touya thought she had put something in the pancakes. XDD Tomoyo and Yukito then came along and Tomoyo brought cake. Kero and Sakura both wanted some, and Yukito went up to see Touya.<br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>
In Touya's room, Yukito said that Touya was associated with the things he saw in the forest, and he fell as a result of seeing them. Yukito puts hand on Touya's injured foot and said he was a kind person, and Touya stuffed a piece of pancake in Yukito's mouth. *^.^* Meanwhile, Sakura and Kero had almost finished the cake, and Kero remarked that he knew she could do it...
