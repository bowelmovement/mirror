<b>Description:</b>

<p>The Mirror is a special card: a helix, which means that its form is hidden. The Card Captor must identify it before he/she can capture it. Sakura had to use the Shadow, the Watery, and the Illusion card to identify it. Once the Card Captor identifies it and says its name, the card loses its power. The Mirror Card is a very gentle card and belongs to Sakura Kinomoto.</p><br>


<b>Power and Attack:</b><br>
<p>
The Mirror has the power to reflect any image before it, and obviously, it can manipulate itself into an actual mirror. It can also transform into a replicate of someone.
