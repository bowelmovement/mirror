<b>x. Enlightenment -- Dub Changes</b><br>

<p>
The North American dubbed version of CCS (under the company <i>Nelvana</i>) is notoriously famous among anime fans for being terrible. Below is a list of changes made in the dubs that pertains to the Mirror. The dubbed title of the episode featuring the Mirror was <i>Double Take</i>, and debuted on August 19, 2000. Of course, specific dialect were changed, but some were fitting, so we won't go through every single dialect changed. Despite that, there are still a ton of precious moments edited out.
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> The first change made was where Yukito was giving Touya a haircut, and then gave Sakura a haircut. This scene was edited off primarily because they did not want to expose Yukito and Touya's relationship.
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> Therefore, <i>Nelvana</i> also edited out Kero's comments on Sakura's haircut for the sake of having the episode to still make sense, that was the second cut.
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> Why this third scene was cut out, I would probably never know. <i>Nelvana</i> edited out Touya teasing Sakura because she offered to help make dinner with Yukito. Touya said something like, any dinner that the "monster" makes would be inedible.
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> <i>Nelvana</i> also edited out Tomoyo's praising on Sakura's haircut the next day at school. This was done to hide Tomoyo's feelings for Sakura.
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> The next change was a dialect change, with Naoko saying everyone has an identical person somewhere in the world, and if you meet that person you will die. Sakura freaked out, but Tomoyo said it was simply a superstition.
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> A dialect of Sakura repeating Kero's words to make the cards reveal links to the Clow Card she was capturing was changed. The meaning was basically the same, except in the dub, Kero rhymed almost everything said. This is the part where I wonder what was wrong with the original dialect... O.o
</p>


<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> This next change couldn't be helped I suppose, but <i>Nelvana</i> cut out the part where Sakura flips over the Flower card and it reminded her of Touya, since his name means Peach Flower. In the dubbed, she just widened her eyes and said, "Tory!" O.o (*cringe*...and we find out she's psychic too, I suppose)
</p>


<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> <i>Nelvana</i> also edited out the part where Touya thought the fake Sakura was a ghost of some sort that had come to the real world to find something. Since Touya can see ghosts, he asked the "ghost" to say hello to his mother when it went back. In the dub, Touya said something about everyone getting lost and having to find their way back...
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> After Sakura capture the card and brought Touya home, Yukito's taste testing of the cake Sakura made was also cut out. *sob* It was so cute too...;_;
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> Finally, <i>Nelvana</i> edited out the part in the end where Sakura asks Kero about his mention of the diaster that would fall upon the world in the first episode. Of course, they failed to show the first episode at the time, so there was no way they could show that.
