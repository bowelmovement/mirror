<b>Description:</b>

<p>In addition to the capture of the Mirror Card, it was also used in various situations to aid Sakura in capturing another clow card. The mirror card is loyal to Sakura, and below are the instances where it aided Sakura in her journey to recover the remaining clow cards.</p>

<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> The Mirror was captured in Episode 25. It was then used in Episode 28, "Sakura and the Incantation Cards," to capture the Shot card by reflecting the Shot card's attacks into itself, thus hurting it and enabling Sakura to capture the card.
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/sakura.gif"> The mirror card was again used in Episode 39, "Sakura's Dizzy Fever Day," when Sakura was sick. The Mirror card transformed into a mirror image of Sakura and took her place in her bed, pretending to be Sakura so Touya wouldn't be suspicious when he came with food and medicine. This enabled Sakura to go and capture the Cloud card. However, Touya suspected that the Sakura that he was attending was not the real Sakura.
