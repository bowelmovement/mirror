<b>x. Enlightenment -- Capture</b><br>

<p>
The Mirror made its debut in episode 25. The episode was called "Sakura to Mouhitori no Sakura," which roughly translates to "Sakura and another Sakura." The episode began with Sakura at a store purchasing stuff. She came home and found Yukito giving Touya a haircut. Yukito offered Sakura a haircut, in which she accepted. In another scene, Meiling and Syaoran were looking at some dresses in a store when Meiling saw Sakura running away. Meiling suspected that Sakura was up to something. In another store, Naoko, Chiharu, and Rika were looking at merchandise when they saw Sakura knock over a bunch of products. Needless to say, they were shocked.
</p>

<p>
Back at the house, Yukito had finished the haircut and Sakura was telling Kero of how she was so happy that she received a haircut from Yukito. Sakura then helped Yukito clean up, and she was even more happy when Yukito praised on how she did a nice job cleaning. Yukito then offered to make dinner, and Sakura said she will help. Touya remarked that anything Sakura makes would be inedible. XD</p>

<p>
The next day, Tomoyo compliments Sakura on her haircut at school. Tomoyo said that she would notice even if Sakura had the littlest trim. *^-^* Sakura comes into the classroom all cheerful, and Chiharu was just about to say something when Meiling abruptly came forth and accused Sakura of wrecking the store products yesterday. Sakura was utterly confused and said she only went to the bread store and was home for the rest of the day. Chiharu then spoke up and said that she and the others also saw someone who looked like Sakura yesterday. Meiling didn't believe it and said she was sure that was Sakura she saw yesterday. Syaoran looked suspicious and told Sakura to be alert and careful. At cheerleading practice, Naoko said that everyone has someone who looks exactly like them somewhere in the world, and if you meet that person, you will die. Sakura freaked out, but Tomoyo reassured her that it was just a superstition. 
</p>

<p>
In the next days, Naoko and Chiharu kept seeing a Sakura messing around and causing trouble. Sakura was sitting with Tomoyo and eating ice cream when Sakura saw her identical self on skates. Then Naoko and Chiharu came by and asked if Sakura had been causing trouble. Tomoyo said that Sakura was with her the entire time.
</p>

<p>
Back at the house, a worried Sakura filled Kero in on the details, and said she felt like it was a clow card. Kero told her to utilize the clow cards to help her. A sequence of clow card arranging followed, and Sakura said her words. She then flipped over the very top card and revealed the Windy. Kero told Sakura that the Windy signified communication and information, and that it knew about Sakura's card captoring. After they talked about the significations, Sakura flipped over 3 other cards, which revealed to be the Shadow, the Watery, and the Illusion. Kero said those are associated with the clow card Sakura is trying to capture and that it will tell of who's in danger. Sakura flipped over the final card, the Flower. Sakura was reminded of Touya, whose name meant Peach Flower, and realized that Touya was the clow card's next target.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, Touya riding his bike when he saw Sakura on skates. She said that she had lost something, and wanted Touya to find it. So Touya got off his bike and went into the forest with Sakura. Meanwhile, Sakura and Kero had raced off to find Touya. They discovered Touya's bike, and went into the forest to find Touya. Sakura couldn't sense exactly where the card was, so she started crying. The fake Sakura was leading Touya deeper and deeper into the woods, and suddenly Touya's foot slipped and he was hanging by one hand off of a high cliff. Slowly, the rock he was hanging onto crumbled and he fell...<br><center>***</center>
</p>


<p>
Back in the other part of the forest, Sakura was desperate and weeping. Syaoran appeared and used his Rashinban to pinpoint Touya's location, since that's where the clow card was...<br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>
Touya was barely concious and said he might be able to find what the fake Sakura was looking for. He thought she was a ghost and that once she finds what she's looking for, she can go back. He also asked her to say hello to his mother when she goes back....<br><center>***</center>
</p>

<p>In the other part of the forest, Sakura and Syaoran were racing to find Touya. Sakura used the Fly card to fly down the cliff with Syaoran and discovered an unconcious Touya and a sad identical Sakura. Sakura was extremely angry with the clow card and attacked it with Windy. Windy went through it harmlessly and Kero called for a stronger attack card. So Sakura used the Watery, which had no effect on the clow card either. Kero then said that this card was a special card, and ordinary ways can't return it to a card. Sakura must know what the card is and say its name to return it to a card. Sakura went close to it and faced it. Kero called for Sakura to think of the card's name. So Sakura closed her eyes and thought hard. When she opened them again, she discovered that the card was imitating her. Sakura then thought of how it has the same ways of operating as the Shadow, it reflects like the Watery, it's not real like the Illusion, so it is...the Mirror Card! With that the Mirror revealed its true form and flew over to Touya and kissed his cheek gently with tears sparkling, and whispered, "I'm sorry..." Sakura then captured the Mirror and returned it to a card. Kero remarked that the Mirror regreted its actions and Sakura got her brother home.
</p>

<p>
When Touya woke up, Sakura brought him food even though Touya claimed he could walk with his injured foot. (and as usual, Kero's sweating like a ham, thinking Touya suspects something XD) Before Sakura went away, she said sorry to Touya. Touya asked what for, and Sakura replied nothing. Touya thought she'd put something in the pancakes. teehee XD Tomoyo and Yukito came by and Yukito and Kero tasted some of the cake that Tomoyo had brought. Sakura then acquired Kero about his mention of the disaster that would fall upon the world, and was determined as ever to capture the rest of the clow cards.
