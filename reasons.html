<b>x. Illusion -- Reasons</b><br>

<p>
Why did I create this shrine? Some of the reasons are already stated in the introduction. I've observed that there are virtually no shrine/site out there that is dedicated to the clow cards in any sort of way. Sure, people have it as part of their CCS site. But that's practically mandatory, since the clow cards are a large part of the story. Yet there are no shrines dedicated to the clow cards alone. I've reasoned that this is probably because of the limited information that's given. It is hard to find more than a short paragraph of any information on the clow cards. Most sites are repetitive, stating when/what episode the clow card is captured and what the clow card's powers are. Most don't even mention the clow cards in the manga.

Now there are 52 clow cards total, so why did I choose to do a shrine on the Mirror card? Well, I think that Mirror has much more characteristic than any other clow card. We first see the Mirror card when it was captured. Sakura learned a new way to utilize the clow cards, and she also had to use the Watery, the Shadow, and the Illusion card to locate and identify Mirror. Second, Mirror has a relationship with Touya. She obviously likes him, but Touya thinks she's a ghost of some short. Touya is able to talk to the Mirror card, and vise versa. The Mirror card portrays a lot more characteristics than any other clow card, and that's also why Mirror is one of my favorite clow cards.
