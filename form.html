<b>Description:</b>

<p>The Mirror takes shape of a young goddess-like girl. She has very light bluegreen hair that flows freely aside from 2 loose buns in the front. Her hair matches with the color of its clothing's inner layer. The clothing of Mirror is also very unique, as with all other clow cards. She is dressed in a kimono type of clothing with a pale white color on the outer layer and bluegreen on the inner layer.  On her forhead is a blue, dimond shaped adornment with two triangles beneath it. She's often seen holding a mirror in her hands, or a mirror somewhere near her.</p>

<p>
The Mirror's alternate form is of course, an actual mirror. The mirror also has a bluegreen color outlining it. It is round with simple designs on the top and bottom of it. On the sides are two handles, with a bunch of bluegreen filaments hung from each handle. The look is very traditional.
