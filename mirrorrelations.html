<b>x. Enlightenment -- Relationships</b><br>

<p>
This section of Reflection explores the Mirror card's relationship with Sakura and Touya. It is not just another clow card that Sakura uses, and it seems quite taken with Touya after the incident where it caused him to fall off of a cliff.

<img src="img/sakura.gif"> <b>Mirror & Sakura</b><br>The Mirror card is basically like a friend to Sakura rather than just another clow card that Sakura utilizes when needed. The Mirror card helps Sakura out very willingly and it is very loyal to Sakura.

The Mirror card obviously has a relationship with Touya. One could say that she has developed a sort of crush on him. He is, of course, taken already,^_^ but one can still dream right?^^ She is quite attracted to him, and this is shown in the episode where the mirror card was utilized to be a fake Sakura so the real Sakura could go and capture the Cloud card. The mirror card enjoyed seeing Touya, and blushed ever so little when Touya patted her on the head. The Mirror is a gentle card, and it even cares somewhat about Touya, since she kissed his cheek after Sakura revealed its true face, because she was sorry that she made him fall off of the cliff. You can see tears sprinkling out of her eyes as she closed them, so you know she was truely sorry. Touya, on the other hand, thinks that she is some sort of ghost, and doesn't really exhibit any romantic affection towards her, which is to be expected.^_^ He treats her almost like his own little sister when the mirror card pretended to be Sakura. Although Touya doesn't have romantic feelings toward the card, he does treat her with friendliness and asked her to say hello to his mother when she returns to the spirit world.
